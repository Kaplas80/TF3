# Translation Framework v3 FAQ

- How can I use it? When I double click on the exe file, it opens a black window and closes inmediately...

  It is a console app. You need to open a terminal or command line to run it.

- But `Translation Framework v2` had windows and it was easier to use...

  Yes, but TF2 was limited to run under Microsoft Windows. TF3 can run on Linux and macOS too. In the future, I want to add a GUI to the app, but I think it is not prioritary.

- I'm a developer, can I help you?

  Of course!! Feel free to fork the project and make your own changes. And, if you have questions about the code, you can open an issue or contact me in Discord: Kaplas#7401

- I'm not a developer, can I help you?

  Yes! There are many tasks that don't need coding skills: identify translatable assets in games, testing and finding bugs...
Contact me if you think you can help with something.

- I want to translate `<game name here>` but it is not supported in TF3. Can you add it?

  I can't promise it: Adding a new game is not an easy task (usually) and I develop this app in my free time, so I can't add all the games.

- But it already supports `<game>`, adding `<game> 2` should be easy!

  Probably, but not always. For example, Yakuza 0 and Kiwami uses the same file formats, but Kiwami 2 is very different.

- I can pay you $XX if you add `<game>`

  Keep it in your pocket. I do it as a hobby in my free time.

- I'm going to send you this game file t...

  STOP!!! Don't share it with me. It is illegal.

- TF3 throws a `Checksum mismatch` error. What can I do?

  There can be two causes for this error:

  1. The game has been updated: In this case, let me know, and I'll update the app as soon as possible.
  2. Your game is a pirated copy: GTFO! I do not condone piracy and you won't get support here.
